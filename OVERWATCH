Overwatch requires a graphics card with drivers that can support recent OpenGL extensions. Only
OpenGL 4.5 has been tested; OpenGL 4.3+ may work. Please use glxinfo to verify your OpenGL version before
reporting issues.

Overwatch tries to detect cheaters. Blizzard may decide that running Overwatch under wine is verboten
and ban you; you have been warned.

There is a good chance that when Overwatch is updated, it will stop working under wine. Even if this
works for you currently, that is not a guarantee of future performance.

Until DirectX 11 support in wine is complete, there are several graphical glitches and the frame rate may
be horrible. Some of these issues are known and some are unknown.


1. Build Instructions

Compile wine as normal for shared WoW64 (https://wiki.winehq.org/Building_Wine#Shared_WoW64).

Install as normal.

The ntdll.dll.fake built by wine must match the one in C:\Windows\System32. Wine will do this automatically
if it detects an update, but if you are building manually you may need to run wineboot update:

$ wine wineboot --update


2. Running Overwatch

It is recommended that you download and run Overwatch using the Battle.net client.

When you run Overwatch, it is recommended that you disable fixme logging because there will be a lot of
error messages on your console otherwise. Run wine with a WINEDEBUG environment variable of "fixme-all":

$ WINEDEBUG=fixme-all ./wine 'c:\program files (x86)\battle.net\battle.net.exe'

If you are having issues running Overwatch through the Battle.net client, then try to run it manually
with wine:

$ ./wine 'c:\program files (x86)\overwatch\overwatch.exe'


3. Development

Some of these patches have been submitted to upstream. Most are not tested enough and/or are known to
break support for other programs. Others, such as the fake ntdll patch, will never be accepted as-is.

We use the 1DTextures patches from wine-staging. Its development is independent. Other wined3d patches
from wine-staging are likely incompatible.


4. Known Issues

a) Winston's bubble and some other effects are opaque.

Overwatch requires support for dual source blending. Current patch fixes this issue but also causes GPU
to crash.

b) Graphics settings higher than Low are unsupported.


5. Troubleshooting

a) Bad or incorrect fake ntdll.dll

If running Overwatch.exe crashes right after these messages:

[some error message...]

Then you probably need to fix your ntdll.dll in your wine system32 directory. It is suggested that in your
wine64 build directory you rm dlls/ntdll/ntdll.dll.fake, make, and cp it into your system32 directory.

Alternatively, ./wine64 wineboot --update, may also fix the issue.
